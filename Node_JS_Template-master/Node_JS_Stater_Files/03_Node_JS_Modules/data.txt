On Windows, if the file descriptor is connected to the console (e.g. fd == 1 or stdout) a string containing non-ASCII characters will not be rendered properly by default, regardless of the encoding used. It is possible to configure the console to render UTF-8 properly by changing the active codepage with the chcp 65001 command. See the chcp docs for more details.
